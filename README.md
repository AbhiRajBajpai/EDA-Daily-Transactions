# Exploratory Data Analysis on Daily Household Transactions

## 📖 About The Project

This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of daily household transactions. [cite_start]The goal is to analyze purchasing behavior, understand money management, and uncover trends in spending and income[cite: 7, 9]. [cite_start]This analysis can be used to forecast expenses and develop better budgeting strategies[cite: 9].
